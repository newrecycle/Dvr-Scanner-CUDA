# Dvr-Scanner-CUDA

dvr scanner rewritten in c++. FOR WIN32! not linux, yet.

this program REQUIRES you have the nvidia cuda toolkit/drivers AND <nvcuvid.h> AND <cuviddec.h>
it also REQUIRES you have built opencv from source with cuda enabled. I will post my makefile configuration upon request.

this program will require opencv built with cuda. 
I have chosen to install all nvidia toolkit drivers, nvcuvid, cudnn, cuviddec and nvEncodeAPI.
nvEncodeAPI will most likely not be used.
